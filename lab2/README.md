# Lab 2

This project runs in the console and quizzes the user on the single-letter codes of randomly selected amino acids. The user has 30 seconds to answer as many questions as possible; a custom quiz duration may also be set by using a command line argument for seconds allotted. The quiz can be terminated at any time by entering `quit`.
