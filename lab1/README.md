# Lab 1

This project generates 1,000 random DNA 3-mers, referred to in the code as codons. These can optionally be printed to the console by uncommenting the print statement. The ```generateCodons``` function requires the specification of desired DNA base probability, in order to achieve a particular base frequency. The observed frequency of the 'aaa' codon is similar to what is expected, however, with a sample size of 1000, there is significant variance between runs of this function. Run this class to see a run summary printed to the console for each of the following base **probability** configurations:

| Base| Config1| Config2|
|:---:|:------:|:------:|
|  A  |  0.25  |  0.12  |
|  C  |  0.25  |  0.38  |
|  G  |  0.25  |  0.39  |
|  T  |  0.25  |  0.11  |
