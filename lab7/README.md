# Lab 7
This project is a Java Swing GUI that finds the prime numbers in a range given between 0 and any number, which may be specified in the modal which appears after clicking the start button. This operation is executed on a background thread, and the GUI shows updates on its progress as well as the result and the running time. The displayed result is truncated to show the first and last 50 prime numbers found, and may be incomplete if the user chooses to stop the operation before it has finished.
