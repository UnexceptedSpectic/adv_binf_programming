# Lab 6
This project is a Java Swing GUI that quizzes users on their knowledge of the single-letter amino acid codes corresponding to each of the 20 standard amino acids. The approximate number of seconds alloted to the user may be set when initializing the `GUI` class with an integer parameter in the constructor.
